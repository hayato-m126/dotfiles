# Added by OrbStack: 'orb' SSH host for Linux machines
# This only works if it's at the top of ssh_config (before any Host blocks).
# This won't be added again if you remove it.
Include ~/.orbstack/ssh/config

# To allow both recommended settings and customizations
# Load configuration files from conf.d
Include conf.d/*.conf

# Due to the behavior where the first found setting takes precedence
# Load globally effective settings last
# Reference: man ssh_config
Include global.conf
